## WinSock2++
WinSock functions wrapped around in C++ OOP classes. With TCP and UDP sockets support. Also has simple initialization and helper functions.

This project doesn't cover the whole winsock library and doesn't plan to cover it. Just created for simple use and learning purposes.

Highly influenced by the book "Multiplayer Game Programming" by Joshua Glazer and Sanjay Madhav
